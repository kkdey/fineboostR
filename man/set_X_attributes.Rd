\title{sets three attributes for matrix X}
\usage{
set_X_attributes(X, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE, LD = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{an N by P data matrix that can be either a trend filtering matrix or a regular dense/sparse matrix}

\item{center}{boolean indicating centered by column means or not}

\item{scale}{boolean indicating scaled by column standard deviations or not}
}
\value{
X with three attributes e.g.
        attr(X, 'scaled:center') is a p vector of column means of X if center=TRUE, a p vector of 0s otherwise.
        attr(X, 'scaled:scale') is a p vector of column standard deviations of X if scale=TRUE, a p vector of 1s otherwise.
        attr(X, 'd') is a p vector of column sums of X.standardized^2,
        where X.standardized is the matrix X centered by attr(X, 'scaled:center') and scaled by attr(X, 'scaled:scale').
        attr(X, 'scaledX') returns the transformed X matrix after mean and standard deviation adjustment of its columns.
        attr(X, 'LD')  returns the correlation or the LD matrix of the P variables of the matrix X.
